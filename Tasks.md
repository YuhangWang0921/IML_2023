# Task Analysis

## Task 1: Prediction 
#### 1.1 pick one regressor
#### 1.2 cross validation
#### 1.3 identify key parameter

## Task 2: Classification
#### 1.1 Translate the reggression problem to classification(around 5)
Define the threshold for each category;

#### 1.2 Convert the classification problem into Multiple Binary Classification Tasks
Using One-vs-All and One-vs-One  Approach
#### 1.3 Solving the problem by logistic Regression
#### 1.4 Comparison

## Task 3: Using boosting to one of those classification problems 

## Task 4: Do dimensionality reduction and clustering

## Task 5: Improve the performance
Using methods in the lecture to increase the performance.(e.g tuning the parameters)
